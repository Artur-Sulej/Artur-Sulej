#### ðŸ‘‹ Hey, Iâ€™m Artur
Iâ€™m a software engineer whoâ€™s been building things for over a decade â€“ starting in Android (Java), moving through Ruby and Elixir and now diving into Rust.

Along the way, I created some open source: 
* [excellent_migrations](https://github.com/artur-sulej/excellent_migrations) â€“ a static analysis tool for Elixir that detects unsafe operations in DB migrations to deploy without surprises
* [reqwest-replay](https://github.com/Artur-Sulej/reqwest-replay) â€“ Rust library to record & replay HTTP calls with `reqwest`
* [Rust eBooks Nightly](https://github.com/Artur-Sulej/rust-ebooks) â€“ automatic daily eBook builds of popular Rust books in EPUB, AZW3, MOBI, PDF formats 

I like DIY projects and anything creative. Programming lets me bring ideas to life without making a mess at home ðŸ˜„

I also enjoy sharing what I learn â€“ check out a few of the talks Iâ€™ve given:

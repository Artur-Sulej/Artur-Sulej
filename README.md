Hey there! My name is Artur. Over the past decade, I’ve honed my skills as a software engineer, tackling projects of various scales and complexities. 
I started my career as an Android developer before moving on to backend with Ruby and Elixir. Finally Rust became my current language of choice. 

I authored a static code analysis tool for Elixir that detects potentially unsafe operations in database migrations, [excellent_migrations](https://github.com/artur-sulej/excellent_migrations).

I’m passionate about DIY projects and anything creative. Programming is my way of bringing my ideas to life without making a mess at home. When I’m not working, you can find me spending quality time and traveling with my family as a happy husband and dad.

I also give talks – you can find them here:

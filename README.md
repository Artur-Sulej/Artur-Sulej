I enjoy DIY and creating stuff. Programming for me is one of those things but without creating mess at home. I also enjoy motorcycling and coffee brewing. 
I started my career as an Android developer, moved to Ruby and fell in love with Elixir and functional programming.
I'm a happy husband and dad.

Hey there! My name is Artur and I'm a software engineer with a passion for DIY projects and anything creative. Programming is my way of bringing my ideas to life without making a mess in my house. In addition to coding, I'm an avid motorcyclist and coffee connoisseur. 

I started my career as an Android developer before moving on to backend with Ruby and Elixir.

When I'm not working, you can find me spending quality time with my family as a happy husband and dad. 

Thanks for stopping by my profile, and I hope you have a great day!

#### 👋 Hey, I’m Artur
I’m a software engineer who’s been building things for over a decade – starting in Android (Java), moving through Ruby and Elixir and now diving into Rust.

Along the way, I created some open source tools: 
* [excellent_migrations](https://github.com/artur-sulej/excellent_migrations) – a static analysis tool for Elixir that detects unsafe operations in DB migrations to deploy without surprises (3M downloads)
* [reqwest-replay](https://github.com/Artur-Sulej/reqwest-replay) – Rust library to record & replay HTTP calls with `reqwest`
* [Rust eBooks Nightly](https://github.com/Artur-Sulej/rust-ebooks) – automatic daily eBook builds of popular Rust books in EPUB, AZW3, MOBI, PDF formats 

My other Rust portfolio: 
* [High-Performance REST service](https://github.com/Artur-Sulej/rolling_stats) – batch data ingestion and real-time statistics (Elixir+Rust via Rustler)
* [AI_devs](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ojU8E8OsCMqI54a-9WfhR3RiS7K_-pKV/view) – solutions to [AI_devs](https://www.aidevs.pl/) Course assignments in Rust (LLM, multimodal, agents, RAG, vector/graph DBs and more)
* [Embedded Rust on ESP32](https://github.com/Artur-Sulej/esp_load_cell) – IoT project using a load cell sensor and HX711 (for Rust Warsaw Meetup talk)
* [rust-clippy contribution](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy/pull/15215) – a new lint that detects decimal literals in bitwise operations.

I like DIY projects and anything creative. Programming lets me bring ideas to life without making a mess at home 😄

I also enjoy sharing what I learn – check out a few of the conf talks I’ve given:
